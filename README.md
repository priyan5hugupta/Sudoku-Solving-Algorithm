# Sudoku-Solving-Algorithm
The research evaluates different Sudoku-solving algorithms based on their time-based complexity. It evaluates the performance of the algorithms Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), Bit Mask, and Cross Hatching. The study evaluates the time it takes each algorithm to solve a problem, showing its flexibility to differing complexities. To understand the time complexity characteristics of the algorithms, they are subjected to a variety of Sudoku puzzles. The study's goal is to provide a more detailed understanding of each algorithm's performance under time limitations, helping developers in choosing acceptable solutions. The results help to optimise algorithms and motivate future advancements in puzzle-solving approaches and computational strategies.
